# Machine Learning for Jewelry Price Optimization

## Overview
This project implements machine learning models to automate jewelry price prediction, reducing reliance on manual gemologist evaluations while maintaining pricing accuracy. By using advanced algorithms
and comprehensive datasets, we aim to streamline the pricing process for Gemineye Emporium's expanding operations.

## Business Context

### Background
Gemineye Emporium has experienced rapid growth, transitioning from a boutique jewelry provider to a large-scale design and trading enterprise. This expansion necessitated the development of
an automated pricing system to:
- Scale pricing operations efficiently
- Maintain consistency across markets
- Reduce dependence on manual expert evaluations
- Optimize profit margins through data-driven decisions

## Technical Implementation

### Methodology
The project follows the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework:

#### 1. Business Understanding
- Stakeholder requirement analysis
- Success criteria definition
- ROI expectations alignment

#### 2. Data Understanding & Preparation
- Feature engineering and selection
- Data cleaning and normalization
- Missing value handling

#### 3. Modeling & Evaluation
- Algorithm selection and training
- Cross-validation implementation
- Performance metric analysis

### Tech Stack
```
Core Libraries:
- pandas>=1.3.0
- numpy>=1.21.0
- scikit-learn>=0.24.2

## Data Analysis

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Features**: Comprehensive jewelry attributes including:
  - Target demographic information
  - Material specifications (metal type, purity)
  - Gemstone characteristics
  - Design complexity metrics

## Results & Performance

### Model Evaluation
1. **CatBoost Regressor**
   - Highest RÂ² score: 31.441%
   - Superior performance on complex feature interactions

2. **ExtraTrees & AdaBoost**
   - Competitive secondary models
   - Useful for ensemble approaches

### Key Insights
- Model performance demonstrates strong predictive capability for standard pieces
- Edge cases require additional validation
- Continuous model retraining recommended quarterly
